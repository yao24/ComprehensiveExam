This program call the module Module_ice_ocean.

    We run some test cases to verify the correctness of the code with three different boundary conditions(BCs), 
    namely Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin.

    Problem with Dirichlet BC is: icase = 1
    Problem with Neumann BC is: icase = 2
    Problem with Robin BC is: icase = 3

    To switch from unit test to ice-ocean, you have to change: text_case = 'unit' or 'ice-ocean'
